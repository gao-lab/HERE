Human embryos were cultured in drops of pre-equilibrated Global media (LifeGlobal # LGGG-20) supplemented with 5 mg/mL protein supplement (LifeGlobal # LGPS-605) and overlaid with mineral oil (Origio #ART-4008-5P). Pre-implantation embryos were incubated at 37oC and 5.5% CO2 in an EmbryoScope+ (Vitrolife) time-lapse incubator for  5-6 days (human).,"Single cells were isolated from blastocyst stage embryos (6-7 days post fertilisation) for subsequent analysis by micromanipulation, with a duration of less than 20 minutes.

The plate was placed on a microscope stage (Olympus IX70) and the embryos were held with an opposing holding pipette and blastomere biopsy pipette (Research Instruments) using Narishige micromanipulators (Narishige, Japan). The biopsy mode of a Saturn 5 laser (Research Instruments) was used to separate the majority of the mural TE from the ICM and polar TE. The ICM and polar TE were washed quickly in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Invitrogen) then placed in 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) for 5 minutes at room temperature.

Embryos were placed in drops of G-MOPS solution (Vitrolife) on a petri dish overlaid with mineral oil. The plate was placed on a microscope stage (Olympus IX70) and the embryos were held with an opposing holding pipette and blastomere biopsy pipette (Research Instruments) using Narishige micromanipulators (Narishige, Japan). The biopsy mode of a Saturn 5 laser (Research Instruments) was used to separate the majority of the mural TE from the ICM and polar TE. The ICM and polar TE were washed quickly in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Invitrogen) then placed in 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) for 5 minutes at room temperature. Trypsin was quenched using Global Media supplemented with 5 mg/mL LifeGlobal Protein Supplement. After quenching, the cell clump was placed back on the stage in a drop of G-MOPS solution and pipetted up and down several times using the blastomere biopsy pipette.Single cells were picked using 100 μm inner diameter Stripper pipette (Origio) and transferred to individual low bind RNAse-free tubes containing 2.5 µl RLP plus buffer.;	Samples were processed using a previously published protocol that was adapted where indicated (Macaulay et al. 2016).To separate RNA from gDNA 50 µl of Dynabeads were washed and incubated with 100 uM biotinylated poly-dT oligonucleotide (IDT). 10 µl of oligo-dT beads were added to each tube containing the single cell.

Amplified cDNA was purified by adding 25 μl SPRI Ampure XP beads, mixing well and incubating at room temperature for 8 min to allow amplified cDNA to bind to the beads. Sample tubes were placed on the magnet and allowed to stand until all beads had been immobilised. Supernatant was removed and discarded and beads were washed twice by adding 200 µl freshly prepared 80% ethanol and leaving for 30 sec before discarding the supernatant.

Here we use CRISPR?Cas9-mediated genome editing to investigate the function of the pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 during human embryogenesis. We identified an efficient OCT4-targeting guide RNA using an inducible human embryonic stem cell-based system and microinjection of mouse zygotes. Using these refined methods, we efficiently and specifically targeted the gene encoding OCT4 (POU5F1) in diploid human zygotes and found that blastocyst development was compromised. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that, in POU5F1-null cells, gene expression was downregulated not only for extra-embryonic trophectoderm genes, such as CDX2, but also for regulators of the pluripotent epiblast, including NANOG.

Embryos were placed in drops of G-MOPS solution (Vitrolife) on a petri dish overlaid with mineral oil. The plate was placed on a microscope stage (Olympus IX70) and the embryos were held with an opposing holding pipette and blastomere biopsy pipette (Research Instruments) using Narishige micromanipulators (Narishige, Japan). The biopsy mode of a Saturn 5 laser (Research Instruments) was used to separate the majority of the mural TE from the ICM and polar TE. The ICM and polar TE were washed quickly in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Invitrogen) then placed in 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) for 5 minutes at room temperature. Trypsin was quenched using Global Media supplemented with 5 mg/mL LifeGlobal Protein Supplement. After quenching, the cell clump was placed back on the stage in a drop of G-MOPS solution and pipetted up and down several times using the blastomere biopsy pipette.Single cells were picked using 100 μm inner diameter Stripper pipette (Origio) and transferred to individual low bind RNAse-free tubes containing 2.5 µl RLP plus buffer.;	Samples were processed using a previously published protocol that was adapted where indicated (Macaulay et al. 2016).To separate RNA from gDNA 50 µl of Dynabeads were washed and incubated with 100 uM biotinylated poly-dT oligonucleotide (IDT). 10 µl of oligo-dT beads were added to each tube containing the single cell.

Amplified cDNA was purified by adding 25 μl SPRI Ampure XP beads, mixing well and incubating at room temperature for 8 min to allow amplified cDNA to bind to the beads. Sample tubes were placed on the magnet and allowed to stand until all beads had been immobilised.
