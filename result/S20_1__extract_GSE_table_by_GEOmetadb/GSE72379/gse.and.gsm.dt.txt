GSE72379,Conserved roles for murine mDUX and human DUX4 in activating cleavage stage genes and MERVL/HERVL retrotransposons [RNA-Seq],Public on Mar 31 2017,2015-08-25,2017-03-31,,"To better understand transcriptional regulation during human oogenesis and pre-implantation embryonic development, we defined stage-specific transcription, which revealed cleavage stage as highly distinctive.  We present multiple lines of evidence that two cleavage-specific homologs, mouse mDUX and human DUX4, each activate hundreds of cleavage-specific endogenous genes (e.g. ZSCAN4, ZFP352, KDM4E) and retroviral elements (MERVL/HERVL-family).  Remarkably, mDux expression converts mouse ESCs into two-cell embryo-like (2C-like) cells by binding to MERVL promoters/enhancers and restoring the chromatin landscape (via ATACseq) to the pattern of mouse two-cell embryos",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Peter,G,Hendrickson;	Jessie,A,Dorais;	Jennifer,L,Whiddon;	Edward,J,Grow;	Candice,L,Wike;	Jongwon Lim;	Christian Pfluegar;	David Nix;	Benjamin,R,Emery;	Krisitin Murphy;	Matthew Peterson;	Stephen,J,Tapscott;	Douglas Carrell;	Bradley,R,Cairns","We derived and analyzed transcriptomes from seven stages of developing human oocytes and embryos.
