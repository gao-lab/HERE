GSE73211,Comparing isogenic pairs of hESC and hiPSC lines reveals genetic background and reprogramming method as primary sources of transcriptional variation,Public on Oct 26 2015,2015-09-18,2015-10-26,,"The equivalency of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) remains controversial. Here, we devised a strategy to assess the contribution of clonal growth, reprogramming method and genetic background to transcriptional patterns in hESCs and hiPSCs. Surprisingly, transcriptional variation originating from two different genetic backgrounds was dominant over variation due to the reprogramming method or cell type of origin of pluripotent cell lines. Moreover, the few differences we detected between isogenic hESCs and hiPSCs neither predicted functional outcome, nor distinguished an independently derived, larger set of unmatched hESC/hiPSC lines.
